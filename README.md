# Image_Segmentation_by_Clustering


## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting images into meaningful regions based on pixel characteristics such as color, intensity, or texture using clustering algorithms. Clustering is an unsupervised learning method, meaning it doesn't rely on labeled data.

## Features
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups pixels into k clusters based on their color, intensity, or spatial information.
- **Mean-Shift Clustering**: Identifies dense regions in feature space without requiring the number of clusters to be specified.
- **DBSCAN**: Groups pixels based on density, useful for segmenting images with irregular shapes and handling noise.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Uses probability distributions to model image data and assigns pixels to clusters based on the probability of belonging to a specific Gaussian component.
- **Agglomerative (Hierarchical) Clustering**: Builds a hierarchy of clusters by merging or splitting them based on pixel similarity.

## Steps in Clustering-Based Segmentation
1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features such as pixel intensity, RGB values, spatial coordinates, and texture.
2. **Clustering**: Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means or GMM) to group similar pixels.
3. **Mapping**: Assign each pixel to its respective cluster, creating segmented regions.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Palgunichandra/Image_Segmentation_by_Clustering.git.
